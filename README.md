# capitalization-fix
 Given the inner HTML containing the body of text with the incorrect capitalization from lightnovelpub.com, the python script cleans up the extra html and hidden text and fixes capitalization issues. The script can take in a text file as a dictionary to fix any capitalization issues with names and proper nouns.
 
 The current text file (rotabas) is meant for "Reincarnation of the Business Women at School", but doesn't have all the proper nouns included.
